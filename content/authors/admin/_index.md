Hi and welcome,
my name is Alberto Mariola and I'm a Cognitive/Computational Neuroscience PhD Student at the University of Sussex. I'm currently part of the [4-Year Sussex Neuroscience PhD Programme](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sussexneuroscience/study/4yearphd) and I'm working at the [Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sackler/) under the supervision of [Prof. Anil Seth](https://www.anilseth.com/), [Dr. Warrick Roseboom](http://www.warrickroseboom.com/) and [Dr. Luc Berthouze](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WvYeh5IAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
